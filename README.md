## Getting Started  

### Ownership Rules
- Each value in Rust has a variable that's called its owner.
- There can only be one owner at a time.
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

### The Rules of References
- At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
- References must always be valid.


### 1. Hello world
```rust
// Hello world
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
